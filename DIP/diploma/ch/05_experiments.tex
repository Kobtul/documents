In experiments we focused on the application protocols that are most 
spread in computer networks and that are thus most widely miss-used. 
In particular we will analyze protocol HTTP and its encrypted version -- HTTPS. 
Most of the network gateways allow only usage of network protocols HTTP or HTTPS. 
As protocol HTTPS uses encryption, the gateway is unable to detect miss-use by 
analyzing content and thus it is unable to enforce policy restrictions.

\textbf{FOLLOWS PART OF OLDER WORK (garbage):}

\section{Introduction}
Motivation for this work is to enable ability to distinguish a periodic behavior of potential threats from ordinary network communication. Example dataset that has been provided for purposes of this work contains a samples of communication of the unknown malware along with the ordinary network communication. Malware had periodically sending  (in interval of 10 seconds) a small amount of data to one concrete host (malware`s server).

Only few of the network communication participants have been analysed, as most of the traffic have not been fully identified. Endpoints, that has been taken in consideration are a proxy server, a host attacked by malware, the malware`s server and host with ordinary web usage (it cannot be considered as an legitimate).

\section{Definitions}
\subsection{Network traffic, gathering the data}
It is possible to represent a network traffic by set of flows distributed in time. The flow is a sequence of packets having  similar attributes. Packets are exchanged usually among network endpoints. Attributes taken under consideration are at least: source and destination endpoint address, port and protocol. Mentioned attributes usualy delimitate flows.

In order to evaluate anomaly rate of paticular flow other properties ought to be taken in account. Especially number of packets and bytes, starting and ending time (time-stamp of the first or the last packet in the flow).

%TODO mention the features 
The time distribution of flows can be determined by considering the starting timestamp of each flow. This approach provides generalized view on the flow, as it has been occured in network channel with unlimited throughput.

Experimental dataset provided for purposes of this work has been extended with classification information, a knowledge if particular endpoint is harmfull or not or even if it is suspicious.

\subsection{Data binning}
In order to reduce minor observation errors binning technique ought to be used. The time axis is divided into disjoint intervals - bins. Let $h$ be number of bins and $\mathbb{F}$ be the set of all flows captured in time interval $\mathbb{T} = (0, T_{max}\rangle $. The $t$-th bin is known as  set of flows $\mathbb{F}_t$ that occurs in time interval $\mathbb{T}_t = ((t-1)\cdot \delta, t\cdot \delta\rangle $ where $t \in \{1, .. h\}$ and $\delta$ is the width of time intervals denoted $\delta = \frac{T_{max}}{h}$. Denote
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_t = \{f : f \in \mathbb{F} \wedge s(f) \in \mathbb{T}_t \}
\end{equation}
where function $s:\mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{N} $ 
returns starting timestamp of the flow $f\in \mathbb{F}$.

For each interval,
representative value is calculated. Following formulas have been considered:
\begin{equation}
r_t^{(1)} = \frac{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_t}b(f)}{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_t}p(f)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
r_t^{(2)} = \log(1+\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_t}p(f))
\end{equation}
where $r_t$ is representative of time interval $t$, $\mathbb{F}_t$ is set of flows captured in time 
interval $t$, function $b:\mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ outputs size of the flow $f$ in bytes and function 
$p:\mathbb{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ outputs the packet count of the flow $f$.

%TODO further description of representatives and features

\subsection{Fourier transformation}
Representatives $r_t$ are subject to transformation from the time domain to the
frequency domain.
This can be achieved by fourier-related
tranforms, e.g. by a fourier or a wavelet transform.
The wavelet transform, unlike the fourier transform, captures
not only a notion of the frequency content of the input, by
examining it at different scales, but also temporal content.

To achieve fast computation, a fast fourier transform (FFT) algorithm 
has been involved.
It is an efficient algorithm to compute the discrete fourier tranform (DFT) and
its inverse.
A DFT decomposes a sequence of values into components of
different frequencies. 
This operation is useful in many fields but computing it directly from the
definition is often too slow to be practical.
An FFT is a way to compute the same result more quickly: 
computing a DFT of N points in the naive way, using the definition, takes
$O(N^2$) arithmetical operations, 
while an FFT can compute the same result in only $ O(N \log N)$ operations.

The sequence of $N$ complex numbers $x_0, ...,x_{N-1}$ is trnasformed into the 
sequence of $N$ complex numbers $X_0, ...,X_{N-1}$ by the DFT according to the formula:
\begin{equation}
X_k = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-\frac{2 \pi i}{N} k n} \quad \quad k = 0, \dots, N-1
\end{equation}
where $i$ is imaginary unit and $e^{-\frac{2 \pi i}{N} k n}$ is $N$-th root of
unity. 

The transform is sometimes denoted as 
$\mathcal{F}\colon\mathbb{C}^N \to \mathbb{C}^N$, e.g.
$\mathbf{X} = \mathcal{F} \left ( \mathbf{x} \right )$.

Before processing the fourier transform, the sequence of representatives 
$r_1, ...,r_h$ is choped into overlaping slices.
Each slice (sequence $r_a, ..., r_b$, where $a$ and $b$ are boundaries
of particular slice) is then transformed by means of fourier transformation,
resulting in sequence of complex coeficients for each slice.
By discarding phase information real coeficients ${R}_i$ are obtained,
where $i = 0, ..., b-a-1$.

Slices are ordered as they are occuring in time and they ought to be numbered
$j = 1,..., g $. The count of slices  depends on the number of elements 
in input sequence $h$, on the slice size $w$ and the step size $s$; one of the
$g=\lfloor\frac{h-w}{s} \rfloor$ or $g=\lceil\frac{h-w}{s} \rceil$.
For the sake of convenience the slice size $w$ is power of two.
Let $a_j$ and $b_j$ be the boundaries of the $j$-th slice. Then
$a_1 = 1$, $b_j = a_j + w$ and $a_{j+1} = a_j + s$.
For the overlaping slices inequality $s < w$ is valid.
Proper values of $s$ and $w$ are subject to research.

Let $\mathcal{R}$ be matrix of fourier coeficients where
$\mathcal{R}_{i,j}$ is $i$-th fourier coeficient of $j$-th slice,
i.e. 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}_{*,j} = abs(\mathcal{F}(r_{a_j}, ..., r_{b_j}))
\end{equation}
The row $\mathcal{R}_{i,*}$ represents a trend of $i$-th fourier
coeficient in time.

\subsection{Distinguishing the endpoints}
As mentioned above experimental dataset contains also
classification information pointing out an level of anomaly of 
particular endpoints. Endpoint is determined by its address.
We now extend the definitions mentioned
former in order to be able to distinct the fourier coeficients for
particular endpoint.

Let $\mathbb{E}$ be a set of all endpoints that
participate in coummunication within time interval $\mathbb{T}$.
Let $\mathbb{F}_{t,u \rightarrow}$ be the set of flows captured in
time interval $\mathbb{T}_{t}$ %TODO: refer
which are \textbf{initiated} by the endpoint $u \in \mathbb{E}$,
similarly $\mathbb{F}_{t, \rightarrow u}$ are \textbf{ended} at the
endpoint $u$. Formaly

\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_{t,u \rightarrow} = \{f : f \in \mathbb{F} \wedge e_{s}(f) = u \wedge s(f) \in \mathbb{T}_t \}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{F}_{t, \rightarrow u} = \{f : f \in \mathbb{F} \wedge e_{d}(f) = u \wedge s(f) \in \mathbb{T}_t \}
\end{equation}
where $e_{s}:\mathbb{F}\rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ and
$e_{d}:\mathbb{F}\rightarrow \mathbb{E}$ 
are functions returning source and destination endpoint for the 
flow $f$.
The representative value of particular bin for particular endpoint is 
then:
\begin{equation}\label{bigrepr1}
r_{t,e}^{(1)} = \frac{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_{t,e}}b(f)}{\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_{t,e}}p(f)}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{bigrepr2}
r_{t,e}^{(2)} = \log(1+\sum\limits_{f\in \mathbb{F}_{t,e}}p(f))
\end{equation}
where index ${}_e$ is replaces symbols ${}_{u\rightarrow}$ or 
${}_{\rightarrow u}$ from previous definition. So it is distinguished 
if the connection is initiated by the endpoint $u$, or ended at the
endpoint $u$.

Matrix of fourier coeficients $\mathcal{R}^\bullet$ is 3-dimensional:
\begin{equation}\label{bigmatrix}
\mathcal{R}^\bullet_{*,j,e} = abs(\mathcal{F}(r_{a_j,e}, ..., r_{b_j,e}))
\end{equation}
First dimension is related to the frequency domain, second to the time domain 
(this is the trend of the fourier coeficients over time), 
and third dimension is related to the endpoint.
We can denote that matrix $\mathcal{R}^{(1)\bullet}$ (resp. $\mathcal{R}^{(2)\bullet}$)
is using representative $r_{t,*}^{(1)}$ (resp. $r_{t,*}^{(2)}$) based on formulas
(\ref{bigrepr1}) and (\ref{bigrepr2}).

\section{Experiments}
Main task is to find an property of the frequency spectrum so that the malicious behavior
can be distinguished. Matrix $\mathcal{R}^\bullet$ provides trend of the frequency spectrum
in time domain for particular endpoint.
Following parameters has been choosen empiricaly:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|rl}
width of bins & $\delta =$ & $1000$ ms \\ \hline
slice width & $w =$ & $128$ \\ \hline
slicing step & $s=$ & $40$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Size of the resulting matrix $\mathcal{R}^\bullet$ is then
$[w\times g\times \lvert\mathbb{E}\rvert]$, where $w=128$, $g=\lfloor\frac{h-w}{s} \rfloor$, 
$h = \lfloor\frac{T_{max}}{\delta}\rfloor$ and $\lvert\mathbb{E}\rvert $ is the number of the 
considered endpoints.

\subsection{Measurements}
The figures \ref{fig:spect_dst_bdivp},
\ref{fig:spect_src_bdivp}, \ref{fig:spect_dst_logp} and \ref{fig:spect_src_logp} are 
showing an mean value of the fourier coeficients along with a standard deviation.
The blue curves are mean values and red are standard deviations added to respectively 
subtracted from mean values. 
The trend of the first momentum in frequency domain has a periodic fluctuations
for the mallware`s target host. Second momentum is
very low for the first 4 fourier coeficient. This properties seems to be unique in 
comparison to other endpoints.


The figures \ref{fig:dens_dst_bdivp}, \ref{fig:dens_src_bdivp},
\ref{fig:dens_dst_logp} and \ref{fig:dens_src_logp} are showing
an kernel density estimation of the value of first six coeficients.
Before the calculation dataset had been put in scale so that the
central mean equals to zero and standard deviation equals to one.
Kernel function is the normal and bandwidth (or smoothing parameter)
is guessed by maximizing likelihood. 
Curves on figure \ref{fig:loglik_src_bdivp} are showing
the dependency of the likelihood on the bandwidth. 
Likelihood is computed as a sum of the logarithms of values of the
partial probability density models evaluated on a testing datasets,
while the model parameters are trained on a training datasets. 
Both, the testing and training datasets are obtained by 5-fold
crossvalidation.
%TODO: formulas

Both the first momentum and the second mometum ought to be taken in
consideration in the process of the anomaly evaluation.
The periodic fluctuations are distinct from the
chaotic behavior of the ordinary endpoints. Low values of second
momentum and the fluctuations in frequency domain are notable too.

\subsection{Implementation}
Anomaly evaluation based on the values of the second momentum has
been implemented as a agent for testing purposes in the Camnep
intrusion detection system. The programming language is Java.
Agent receives an statistics from the data geathering agents and
is called each time the 5-minutes block is received. Matrix
$\mathcal{R}^{(1)\bullet}$ is computed. Row
$\mathcal{R}^{(1)\bullet}_{i,*,e}$ represents a trend of the
coeficient $i$ in time domain for the particular target endpoint $e$.
Standard deviation is then calculated and matrix 
$\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_{i,e}$ of the standard deviations is constructed.
For each coeficient $i$ 10th-percentile $t^{(1)}_i$ is calculated
over all target endpoints $e$, where $t^{(1)}_i$ is a threshold.
Logical matrix $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}_{t,e}$ is then constructed:
$\mathcal{K}^{(1)}_{i,e} = \mathcal{D}^{(1)}_{i,e} \le t^{(1)}_i $.
So for 10\% endpoints with least value of $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}$
it contains value 1 otherwise value 0. Weighted average over the
sequence $\mathcal{K}^{(1)}_{*,e}$ then outputs the level of anomaly
$a_e$ for each target endpoint. 
Weights are choosen empiricaly and some results were obtained giving
weight of $1$ for coeficients $i \in \{1,2,3,4,5\}$, weight of $0.2$
where $i\in \{6,7,... 20\}$ otherwise weight of $0$.

\section{Conclusion}
The implementation is still under development. Next research ougth to be aimed on the modeling of the
frequency spectrums and the fluctuations. More endpoints ought to be taken in consideration. 

Relation between model and different behaviors of the mallware is also important to be investigated.
